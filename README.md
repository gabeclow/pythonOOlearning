Python Object Oriented Programming Learning

1. **Create a Directory ('repos') and Clone Repository:**
   Open the Terminal on your Mac and follow these commands:
   
   ```bash
   # Navigate to your home directory
   cd ~
   
   # Create a 'repos' directory
   mkdir repos
   
   # Navigate to the 'repos' directory
   cd repos
   
   # Clone the GitHub repository
   git clone https://github.com/gabeclow/pythonOOlearning.git
   ```

2. **Install Visual Studio Code and Python Extension:**
   If you haven't already, download and install Visual Studio Code from the official website: https://code.visualstudio.com/

   Once installed, open Visual Studio Code and follow these steps:

   a. Install the Python extension:
      - Click on the Extensions icon on the left sidebar (or press `Ctrl + Shift + X`).
      - Search for "Python" and select the official Python extension by Microsoft.
      - Click the Install button.

3. **View Output in Visual Studio Code:**
   To view the output of Python code within Visual Studio Code, follow these instructions:

   a. Open the Python file you want to run.
   
   b. Right-click within the file editor.
   
   c. From the context menu, choose "Run Python File in Terminal".
   
   d. In the terminal that opens at the bottom of the window, you'll see the output of your Python code.
   
   e. If required, click the Run button (usually a green arrow) in the top-right corner of the file editor to execute the code and see the output.

Remember, before running the code, ensure that you have navigated to the correct directory containing your Python file within Visual Studio Code. If the file is located in the `pythonOOlearning` repository you cloned earlier, navigate to that directory in Visual Studio Code before proceeding with the steps above.
